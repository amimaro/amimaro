### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Brazilian with Lebanese roots, passionate about new technologies and what they can provide us. I currently working with web development and during this way I ended up leaning more towards the front-end where I have been improving myself in the most up-to-date frameworks on the market. 

If I weren't a programmer, you would see me baking delicious breads and pizzas because gastronomy is one of my passions besides traveling and enjoying the family. 

Currently I've been studying more about blockchain technologies in order to create my own projects.
